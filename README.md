# solar_logic
## Logical arduino code for portable solar generator project

**Linux:**
If you are using linux I suggest downloading this makefile compile for the Arduino:
 -https://github.com/rubend056/arduino_make_template 
  -Just save the folder under the src folder and read the makefile for compiling instructions. Easy!

**Windows:**
If using Windows you must use the ArduinoIDE or any text editor of your choice.
In order to use the ArduinoIDE with this project you must download the common folder and place it 
in the Arduino->Libraries folder. You should update the board.txt file if you are using the AVR programmer

**MAC:**
Use above windows method
